### Skills Used
  - Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
  - Blender
  - User Surveys/Research
  - Social Media Marketing (Reddit, Instagram)

### Overview

KAM Soaring Skies is a multi-year project designing mechanical keyboard parts for sale across international vendors in a Kickstarter-esque group buy format. This site was coded with the same keyboard as seen above! [Gallery of customer examples](https://imgur.com/a/c52mnXK)

### What I learned

- How to work with e-commerce vendors and consumers both locally and abroad
- Designing products with ease of use for keyboard hobbyists with non-standard/international key layouts
- Incorporation of user research, surveying, and online critique to improve the end product
- How to render 3D prototypes with Blender

### In Depth

I'd always wanted to make a design for one of my favorite hobbies: the custom mechanical keyboard community. Through lots of drafts and revisions, I began to develop a aviation-inspired design concept which would take over 2 years to see to completion. The keyboard caps had all of the characters/symbols/novelty keys aligned by hand, and were manufactured with a glossy coat to make the colors and feel stand out from the most common options within the mechanical keyboards hobby.

The community's feedback was also critical in this project, and I employed 2 rounds of user surveys to get feedback on the configuration of the product and ensure that my project was kitted for as many users as possible. When creating the Interest Check, my user survey had a few goals:

#### User Survey Goals:
 - Are all of the keycap kits properly kitted for users? Are my Japanese keycap kits properly fitted for Japanese hobbyists?
 - What artisans would the community like for me to collaborate with?
 - Gain insight from the community to see what design suggestions they have.
 - Gauge popularity for my project, and the odds of success if it went to group buy.

#### User Survey Questions:
1. Where did you find this post? (Social Media Platform)
2. Which keycap kits would you be interested in buying?
3. Are there any collaborations you would like to see for KAM Soaring Skies?
4. What suggestions do you have for the kit? Any changes you would like to see? (Ex: Different sublegends, changes to kitting)
5. Anything else?

#### Findings:
- While not many users showed initial interest, those who did expressed great support. I received 66 responses, though more popular sets tend to get around 100+.
- My kitting had a lot of initial errors, and users wanted more sets. This sparked a change from 13 to 21 total kits available for purchase.
- The suggestion from the community to make this keycap set implement glossy keycaps ended up being the strongest selling point for the keycaps when they went on sale. This change alone was the largest contributor to the success in selling my keycap set.

When I started, I didn't know how to render my keyboard project in 3D, which is a necessity in the hobby. Commissioning a 3D artist was not in my budget at the time, so I resolved to learn the process from start to finish in the span of a week. The renders were possible thanks to a community tool for Blender. [All renders can be seen here](https://imgur.com/a/TjAP57r) and the picture below was a render used to advertise the product.

After reaching out to various vendors in the community, I had found a vendor in Vala Supply. They are an Oregon-based keyboard retailer that was more than happy to help make my set a reality, but we needed global reach to get this sale done. I got in touch with 7 different vendors from around the world, as well as the intended manufacturer of KAM Soaring Skies: Keyreative. Through their help, we were able to organize the sale and get it running. The group buy ended in November of 2021 and reached ~$70,000 in sales in one month, with an arrival time of April 2023 for end consumers who purchased the set!
