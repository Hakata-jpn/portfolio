Iâ€™m a UX Designer with 3 years of industry experience, mostly for eCommerce and nonprofit organizations. Currently working for Keurig, but previous clients include the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Spartan Chemical. My specializations are in design systems for developer hand-off as well as layout design for web and mobile screens. I also have a minor interest in front-end development, which inspired me to make this site by hand!

Outside of work, I design [mechanical keyboard parts](https://vala.supply/collections/ended-group-buys/products/kam-soaring-skies) and shoot [weird cameras, mostly analog.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/86XujY5FcK6Zi6xD9) Outside of the house you can catch me skating, playing seasonal sports, or making tier lists about Chicago's food and coffee places.
