<p>Iâ€™m a UI/UX Designer with 2.5 years of industry experience, mostly for wholesale e-commerce and nonprofit organizations. Formerly working in agency, my clients include a 9-figure non-profit in the healthcare education sector, as well as a $100m+ wholesale client in the sanitation industry. My specializations are in component design for developer hand-off as well as layout design for web. I also have a minor interest in front-end development, as you can see this site was made in-house!</p>

<p>Outside of work, I design <a href="https://vala.supply/collections/ended-group-buys/products/kam-soaring-skies">mechanical keyboard parts</a> and shoot <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/86XujY5FcK6Zi6xD9">film photography</a>. Outside of the house, you can catch me skating, playing seasonal sports, or patiently awaiting the next ski season.</p>
