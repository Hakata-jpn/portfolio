### Overview

Used a previously developed UX Assessment from a lead UX Designer to create new wireframes and update the site experience for users of a $100m+ wholesale eCommerce site.

### What I learned

- How to use a design assessment to make design updates to a website
- Complex page interactions with via Axure RP
- How UX Architecture contributes to the site design process, and how UI facilitates a user's navigation through the site
- How to present designs directly to stakeholders
- Importance of Figma's Component and Auto-layout features in a large-scale UI project
- How to create a tree test and sell it to a client

### In Depth

In the summer of 2022, the design team at Adage developed a UX site assessment on behalf of the current client. With a multitude of changes recommended (20+ broad changes, Site Architecture update) I worked on the UI design work for the project. With that, I designed the following pages and components: 

1. Header
2. How to Buy Page
3. Product Detail Page (PDP)
4. Sticky Table of Contents for PDP
5. Product Listing Page (Category & Search Based)
6. Product Category filters
7. Homepage

Due to the sensitive nature of the work, further details have to be withheld. What can be said is that the overall work was completed using Figma, with complex interactions wireframed via Axure. The use of component state as well as variants made the building of the site a lot easier and more consistent across the various wireframes, which was very new to me at the time of the project. A demo of the sticky TOC can be seen below, which was completed in Axure. This interaction took a long time to properly work because of where the component was initially located before becoming sticky, but it was important to demonstrate to demo to the client and was completed on their behalf.

*This example was made in After Effects, to simulate what the client might have seen. The subheader location made this interaction very difficult to recreate in Axure.*

The nature of the work led to client presentations every two weeks to discuss the progress of the wireframes and the site architecture testing. We had a tree testing process set up for the client and were awaiting their word on whether or not to proceed at the time.
